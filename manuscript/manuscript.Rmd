# Introduction

The ability to accurately forecast water temperature, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll concentration in freshwater systems is significant to natural resource management. Since water temperature, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll concentration effect many biological and physical processes in freshwater ecosystems \cite{oullet-proulx, Stajkowski, Chen}, preemptive forecasts of these variables could allow managers to circumvent scenarios with far-reaching negative impacts. Yet, forecasting these variables is challenging because they are influenced by many processes that are hard to predict and characterize. Limnologists have historically used empirical and process-based models to forecast water quality metrics, but in recent years, researchers have shown that machine learning can outperform these traditionally used methods \cite{Hanson, others}. A shortcoming of these studies which support machine learning is that they tend to focus on a handful of sites that are not necessarily representative of sites in different geographic regions. This paper has the primary aim of making a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art machine learning methods by examining how these models perform at 34 different sites across North America at different times of the year.

The time series that are used in this study are taken from the National Ecological Observatory Network's Ecological Forecasting Challenge, an open challenge where teams can submit forecasts to the publicly accessible data \cite{Quinn}. A common theme across the challenge is that a historical means (or climatology) model tends to be a top performing model \cite{Dietze, Quinn}. Thus, a primary consideration in this paper is the comparison of the machine learning models to the climatology model. If machine learning models can consistently outperform the climatology model, then machine learning is clearly a promising method class for limonological time series forecasting.





** Talk about NEON forecasting challenge and how this offers an unprecedented opportunity to test machine learning models. Typically ML models have been applied to a handful of freshwater systems; the forecasting challenge offers 34 sites across North America and Puerto Rico as a testing ground. Historically, researchers have favored using process-based models to make forecasts, but building mechanistic models for 34 sites is very challenging. Thus, leveraging non-mechanistic machine learning models offer some practical advantages. Machine learning models have been applied to limnological time series forecasting at varying levels of success. Generally, the machine learning models tended to be more basic, like RNN's and LSTM's, in the interim, new models have been developed that are said to outperform these earlier ML models. This study makes a comparison of some the newly touted state of the art machine learning models on the aquatics time series taken from NEON. From a current literature search, no previous paper has made as comprehensive of a comparison of machine learning models on the variables of water temperature, chlorophyll concentration and dissolved oxygen.
