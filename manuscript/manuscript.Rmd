# Introduction

The ability to accurately forecast water temperature, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll concentration in freshwater systems is significant to natural resource management. Since water temperature, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll concentration effect many biological and physical processes in freshwater ecosystems \cite{oullet-proulx, Stajkowski, Chen}, preemptive forecasts of these variables could allow managers to circumvent scenarios with far-reaching negative impacts. Yet, forecasting these variables is challenging because they are influenced by many processes that are hard to predict and characterize. Limnologists have historically used empirical and process-based models to forecast water quality metrics, but in recent years, researchers have shown that machine learning can outperform these traditionally used methods \cite{Hanson, others}. A shortcoming of these studies which support machine learning is that they tend to focus on a handful of sites that are not necessarily representative of sites in different geographic regions. This paper has the primary aim of making a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art machine learning methods by examining how these models perform at 34 different sites across North America at different times of the year.

The time series that are used in this study are taken from the National Ecological Observatory Network's Ecological Forecasting Challenge, an open challenge where teams can submit forecasts to the publicly accessible data \cite{Quinn}. A common theme across the challenge is that a historical means (or climatology) model tends to be a top performing model \cite{Dietze, Quinn}. In a model comparison for the phenology challenge, \cite{Dietze} found that the climatology outperformed all but one of the submitted models, and the best performing forecast only marginally outperformed the climatology model. Thus, a primary consideration in this paper is the comparison of the machine learning models to the climatology model. If deep learning models can consistently outperform the climatology model, then deep learning is clearly a promising method class for limonological time series forecasting.

Talk about Darts, and how there have been newly developed deep learning models that offer advantages over the more vanilla ones that are commonly used. The advantage of taking the machine learning approach is that it allows the ability to easily deploy models on systems without having a mechanistic understanding of them. This is especially advantageous in the current era where sensors can be deployed at a much faster rate than we can build accurate water quality models for every existent body of water. Like Sci-kit Learn or Tidy Models, Darts allows users to easily instantiate, fit and predict with these state of the art models without requiring users to create these models from scratch.
